    "#### Task 1 **[40 points] Bayes Parameter Estimation** \n",
    "\n",
    "Please answer each of the following three questions with step-by-step calculations **and thorough answers/explanations**, using python code and suitable plots. \n",
    "1. **Scenario:** You are an astronomer investigating the prevalence of exoplanets around a particular type of star in a nearby galaxy cluster. From extensive surveys, you know that approximately 15% of these stars host an exoplanet. Your telescope’s detection system is quite sensitive: if a star truly has an exoplanet, the system will indicate a detection 90% of the time (true positive rate). However, the system still produces a small fraction of false positives: 5% of stars without exoplanets are incorrectly flagged as having one. Now suppose you receive a detection signal from one star under observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Question:** Using Bayes’ Theorem, calculate the probability that this star truly hosts an exoplanet, given that the telescope indicated a detection.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scenario:** You have two identical-looking boxes on your desk, each containing small toy blocks of different colors. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Box A has 4 red blocks and 6 green blocks.<br>\n",
    "    - Box B has 7 red blocks and 3 green blocks.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    You randomly choose one box (each with 50% probability) and then randomly draw one block from that box.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Questions:** <br>\n",
    "    (a) What is the probability of drawing a red block?<br>\n",
    "    (b) Given that you drew a red block, what is the probability that it came from Box B?<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scenario:** You are playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons and facing a main villain controlled by the Dungeon Master (DM). This villain always makes attacks with two weapons, but you only observe the total of the damage rolls (the sum of both dice) on each attack. You know that each weapon die must be one of the four types d6, d8, d10 or d12 (dX = X-sided die) and there is no duplication of weapons—meaning the two dice must be different (for example, the pair could be a d6 and d8, but not two d6s). Your working hypothesis is that the DM is using a d8 and a d10.<br><br>\n",
    "    **Question:** What is the probability that your hypothesis is correct, given the most recent six total damage values (the last six attack rolls) have been [6, 12, 14, 11, 9, 10]?"
